    <abstract>
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE)
        "ANY". The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose
        not to respond to such queries for reasons of local policy,
        motivated by security, performance or other reasons.</t>

      <t>The DNS specification does not include specific guidance
	for the behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this situation.
        This document aims to provide such guidance.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses terminology specific to the Domain Name
        System (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology"/>.</t>

      <t>In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts, this document
        refers to the host sending a DNS request as the initiator, and
        the host sending a DNS response as the responder.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY"
        and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Struggle to find something to say that wasn't already covered
        by the abstract. Perhaps describe conventional responses to
        QTYPE=ANY queries as context for the following section.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivations">
      <t>Describe use-cases for suppressing conventional responses to
        QTYPE=ANY queries here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Behaviour of DNS Responders" anchor="responder">
      <t>A DNS responder which receives a query with QTYPE=ANY MAY
	decline to provide a conventional response, and instead
	send a response with a single HINFO resource record in the
	answer section.  The CPU field of the HINFO RDATA SHOULD
	be set to RFCXXXX [note to RFC Editor, replace with RFC
	number assigned to this document].  The OS field of the
	HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to the null string to minimise
	the size of the response.</t>

      <t>If the DNS query includes DO=1 and the QNAME corresponds
        to a zone that is known by the responder to be signed, valid
        RRSIG resource records should also be returned.</t>

      <t>Except as described in this section, the DNS responder
	MUST follow the standard algorithms when constructing a
	response.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Behaviour of DNS Initiators">
      <t>A DNS initator which sends a query with QTYPE=ANY and
        receives a response containing an HINFO, as described in
        <xref target="responder"/>, MAY cache the HINFO response
        in the normal way. Such cached HINFO resource records should
        be retained in the cache following normal caching semantics,
        as would be used for any other cached response.</t>

      <t>A DNS initiator MAY suppress queries with QTYPE=ANY in the
        event that the local cache contains a matching HINFO resource
        record with RDATA.CPU as described in <xref target="responder"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Changes to RFC 1035">
      <t>Spell out the particular changes to 1035 implied by this
        document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Queries with QTYPE=ANY are frequently observed as part of
	reflection attacks, since a relatively small query can be
	used to elicit a large response; this is a desirable
	characteristic if the goal is to maximise the amplification
	potential of a DNS server as part of a volumetric attack.
	The ability of a DNS operator to suppress such responses
	on a particular server makes that server a less useful
	amplifier.</t>

      <t>The optional behaviour described in this document to reduce
        the size of responses to queries with QTYPE=ANY is compatible
        with the use of DNSSEC by both initiator and responder.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document has no IANA actions.</t>
