    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses terminology specific to the Domain Name
        System (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in
        <xref target="RFC7719"/>.</t>

      <t>In this document, "ANY Query" refers to a DNS query with
        QTYPE=ANY. An "ANY Response" is a response to such a query.</t>

      <t>In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts, this document
        refers to the host sending a DNS request as the initiator, and
        the host sending a DNS response as the responder.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY"
        and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE)
        "ANY". The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose
        not to respond to such queries for reasons of local policy,
        motivated by security, performance or other reasons.</t>

      <t>The DNS specification <xref target="RFC1034"/> <xref
        target="RFC1035"/> does not include specific guidance
	for the behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this situation.
	This document aims to provide such guidance.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivations">
      <t>ANY queries are legitimately used for debugging and checking
	the state of a DNS server for a particular owner name. ANY
	queries are sometimes used as a attempt to reduce the number
	of queries needed to get information, e.g. to obtain MX, A
	and AAAA RRSets for a mail domain in a single query, although
	there is no documented guidance available for this use case
	and some implementations have been observed that appear not
	to function as perhaps their developers expected. For any
	developer that assumes that ANY query will be sent to
	authoritative server to fetch all RRsets, they need a
	fallback when that does not happen.</t>

      <t>ANY queries are also frequently used to exploit the amplification
        potential of DNS servers using spoofed source addresses and
        UDP transport (see <xref target="RFC5358"/>). Having the ability
        to return small responses to such queries makes DNS servers
        less attractive amplifiers.</t>

      <t>ANY queries are sometimes used to help mine authoritative-only
	DNS servers for zone data, since they are expected to return all RRSets for
	a particular owner name. A DNS operator MAY prefer
	not to send large ANY responses to reduce the potential
	for information leaks.</t>

      <t>Some authoritative-only DNS server implementations require
	additional processing in order to send a conventional
	ANY response, and avoiding that processing
	expense might be desirable.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="General Approach"> 
      <t>This proposal provides a mechanism for an authority server
	to signal that conventional ANY queries are not supported
	for a particular QNAME, and to do so in such a way that
	is both compatible with and triggers desirable behaviour by
        unmodified clients (e.g. DNS resolvers).</t>

      <t>Alternative proposals for dealing with ANY queries have been
	discussed. One approach proposed using a new RCODE to signal
	that an authortitaive server did not answer ANY queries in
	the standard way. This approach was found to have an
	undesirable effect on both resolvers and authoritative-only
	servers; resolvers receiving an unknown RCODE caused them
	to re-send the same query to all available authoritative
	servers, rather than suppress future such ANY queries for
	the same QNAME.</t>

      <t>This proposal avoids that outcome by returning a non-empty
	RRSet in the ANY response, providing resolvers
	with something to cache and effectively suppressing repeat
	queries to the same or different authority servers.</t>

      <t>This proposal specifies two different modes of behaviour
        by DNS responders, and operators are free to choose
        whichever mechanism best suits their environment.

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>A DNS responder MAY choose to search for an owner
            name that matches the QNAME and, if that name owns
            multiple RRSets, return just one of them or a selected
            subset. Full RRset(s) MUST be returned.
	  </t>

          <t>A DNS responder for whom a search for an owner name
	    with an existing resource record is expensive MAY return instead 
	    synthesised HINFO resource. See <xref target="hinfo"/> for discussion of the
            use of HINFO.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Behaviour of DNS Responders" anchor="responder">
      <t>A DNS responder which receives an ANY query MAY decline
	to provide a conventional response, and MAY instead send a
	response with a single RRSet in the answer section.</t>

      <t>The RRSet returned in the answer section of the response
	MAY be a single RRSet owned by the name specified in the
	QNAME. Where multiple RRSets exist, the responder MAY choose
	a small one to reduce its amplification potential.</t>

      <t>If there is no CNAME present at the owner name matching
	the QNAME, the resource record returned in the response MAY
	instead be synthesised, in which case a single HINFO resource
	record SHOULD be returned.  The CPU field of the HINFO RDATA
	SHOULD be set to RFCXXXX [note to RFC Editor, replace with
	RFC number assigned to this document].  The OS field of the
	HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to the null string to minimise
	the size of the response.</t>

      <t>The TTL encoded for a synthesised RR SHOULD be chosen by the
        operator of the DNS responder to be large enough to suppress
        frequent subsequent ANY queries from the same initiator with
        the same QNAME, understanding that a TTL that is too long
        might make policy changes relating to ANY queries difficult
        to change in the future. The specific value used is hence
        a familiar balance when choosing TTLs for any RR in any zone,
        and be specified according to local policy.</t>

      <t>If the DNS query includes DO=1 and the QNAME corresponds
	to a zone that is known by the responder to be signed, a valid
	RRSIG for the RRSets in the answer section MUST be
	returned. In case DO=0 RRSIG SHOULD be omitted.</t>

      <t>Except as described in this section, the DNS responder
	MUST follow the standard algorithms when constructing a
	response.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Behaviour of DNS Initiators">
      <t>A DNS initator which sends a query with QTYPE=ANY and
        receives a response containing an HINFO, as described in
	<xref target="responder"/>, MAY cache the HINFO response
	in the normal way. Such cached HINFO resource records SHOULD
	be retained in the cache following normal caching semantics,
	as it would with any other response received from a DNS
	responder.</t>

      <t>A DNS initiator MAY suppress queries with QTYPE=ANY in the
	event that the local cache contains a matching HINFO resource
	record with RDATA.CPU field, as described in <xref
	target="responder"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="HINFO Considerations" anchor="hinfo">
      <t>In the case where a zone that contains HINFO RRSets is
	served from an authority server that does not provide
	conventional ANY responses, it is possible that the HINFO
	RRSet in an ANY response, once cached by the initiator,
	might suppress subsequent queries from the same initiator
	with QTYPE=HINFO. The use of HINFO in this proposal would
	hence have effectively mask the HINFO RRSet present in
	the zone.</t>

      <t>Authority-server operators who serve zones that rely upon
	conventional use of the HINFO RRType MAY sensibly choose
	not to deploy the mechanism described in this document or
	select other type.</t>

      <t>The HINFO RRType is believed to be rarely used in the DNS
	at the time of writing, based on observations made both at
	recursive servers and authority servers.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Changes to RFC 1035">
      <t>It is important to note that returning a subset of available
	RRSets when processing an ANY query is legitimate and
	consistent with <xref target="RFC1035"/>; ANY does not mean
	ALL.</t>

      <t>This document describes optional behaviour for both DNS
        initators and responders, and implementation of the guidance
        provided by this document is OPTIONAL.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Queries with QTYPE=ANY are frequently observed as part of
	reflection attacks, since a relatively small query can be
	used to elicit a large response; this is a desirable
	characteristic if the goal is to maximise the amplification
	potential of a DNS server as part of a volumetric attack.
	The ability of a DNS operator to suppress such responses
	on a particular server makes that server a less useful
	amplifier.</t>

      <t>The optional behaviour described in this document to reduce
        the size of responses to queries with QTYPE=ANY is compatible
        with the use of DNSSEC by both initiator and responder.</t>
