     Providing Minimal-Sized Answers to DNS Queries with QTYPE=ANY
                    draft-jabley-dnsop-refuse-any-00

Abstract

   The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE) "ANY".
   The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to
   respond to such queries for reasons of local policy, motivated by
   security, performance or other reasons.

   The DNS specification does not include specific guidance for the
   behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this situation.  This document
   aims to provide such guidance.

1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to the Domain Name System
   (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology].

   In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts, this document
   refers to the host sending a DNS request as the initiator, and the
   host sending a DNS response as the responder.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Struggle to find something to say that wasn't already covered by the
   abstract.  Perhaps describe conventional responses to QTYPE=ANY
   queries as context for the following section.

3.  Motivations

   Describe use-cases for suppressing conventional responses to
   QTYPE=ANY queries here.

4.  Behaviour of DNS Responders

   A DNS responder which receives a query with QTYPE=ANY MAY decline to
   provide a conventional response, and instead send a response with a
   single HINFO resource record in the answer section.  The CPU field of
   the HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to RFCXXXX [note to RFC Editor, replace
   with RFC number assigned to this document].  The OS field of the
   HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to the null string to minimise the size of
   the response.

   If the DNS query includes DO=1 and the QNAME corresponds to a zone
   that is known by the responder to be signed, valid RRSIG resource
   records should also be returned.

   Except as described in this section, the DNS responder MUST follow
   the standard algorithms when constructing a response.

5.  Behaviour of DNS Initiators

   A DNS initator which sends a query with QTYPE=ANY and receives a
   response containing an HINFO, as described in Section 4, MAY cache
   the HINFO response in the normal way.  Such cached HINFO resource
   records should be retained in the cache following normal caching
   semantics, as would be used for any other cached response.

   A DNS initiator MAY suppress queries with QTYPE=ANY in the event that
   the local cache contains a matching HINFO resource record with
   RDATA.CPU as described in Section 4.

6.  Changes to RFC 1035

   Spell out the particular changes to 1035 implied by this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   Queries with QTYPE=ANY are frequently observed as part of reflection
   attacks, since a relatively small query can be used to elicit a large
   response; this is a desirable characteristic if the goal is to
   maximise the amplification potential of a DNS server as part of a
   volumetric attack.  The ability of a DNS operator to suppress such
   responses on a particular server makes that server a less useful
   amplifier.

   The optional behaviour described in this document to reduce the size
   of responses to queries with QTYPE=ANY is compatible with the use of
   DNSSEC by both initiator and responder.
